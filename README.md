### Goal: Create a two player Tic-Tac-Toe game. The users should be able to click to place their X or O and if they win the program should mention their win in the DOM. Please make the game as OOP as possible.

### How it's made:
This game was made using HTML, CSS and Javascript with as much object-oriented programming. This is also a mobile, tablet, and desktop responsive game.

### Lessons learned were object oriented program:
By making code resemble real-world objects, object-oriented programming makes the code easier to think about. It’s about organizing concepts in an understandable way.
